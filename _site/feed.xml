We analyze CRF based classification model for metaphor detection using syntactic, conceptual, affective, and word embeddings based features which are extracted from MRC Psycholinguistic Database (MRCPD) and WordNet-Affect. We use word embeddings given by Huang et al. to capture information such as coherence and analogy between words. To tackle the bottleneck of limited coverage of psychological features in MRCPD, we employ synonymy relations from WordNet®. A comparison of our approach with previous approaches shows the efficacy of CRF classifier in detecting metaphors. The experiments conducted on VU Amsterdam metaphor corpus provides an accuracy of more than 92% and F-measure of approximately 78%. Results shows that inclusion of conceptual features improves the recall by 5% whereas affective features do not have any major impact on metaphor detection in open text.&lt;/p&gt;
